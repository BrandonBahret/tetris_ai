### Note:
This codebase has been redacted of any programming that could be used to create unofficial bots. The use of bots even in solo/custom games is forbidden. As such, it wouldn't be appropriate to distribute a working version of this software. All other portions of the codebase remains here intact. This repository exists merely for portfolio reference.

Specifically, the `Observation` layer has been stripped of code responsible for parsing gamestates.
