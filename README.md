### Note:
This codebase has been redacted of any programming that could be used to create unofficial bots. I originially was not aware that the use of bots *even in solo/custom games* is forbidden. As such, it no longer seems appropriate to distribute a working version of this software. All other portions of the codebase remains here intact.
